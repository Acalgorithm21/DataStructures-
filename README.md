#Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Resource 

A personal learning resoure website designed to explain and teach core data structures
and algorithms concepts through clear explanations, examples, and visual intuition. 

## Why This Project?

Data Structures and Algorithms can feel abstract when learned only
from textbooks or problem sets. I created this website to reinforce
my understanding by breaking concepts down into:

- Plain-language explanations
- Visual and step-by-step examples
- Practical use cases

My intention is to make learning Data Structures & Algorithms more intuitive and comprehensive 
for other students, or self learners, that want to upgrade their programming skills and 
knowledge. Datastructures and algorithms are a necessary skill set for aspiring software engineers/developers 
to deliver high quality code and solving problems while also being mindful of system resources. 

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Time & Space Complexity
- Big-O Analysis

## Structure

Each abstract data type will have its own implementations, examples, visualizations, and operations.
Coupled with recommended data structures and comparisons using Big 0 analysis calculating time 
and space complexity. 

## Tech Stack

As you will see in the repository here are my tools used to make this project possible. 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python Flask Backend
- Onsite code examples (Python, Javascript, Java, C++)
- Jinga Templating 
- Git & GitHub for version control

## What I’m Learning

- How to explain technical concepts clearly
- Translating abstract algorithms into practical intuition
- Organizing technical knowledge for others
- Writing clean, readable code examples
- How to apply what I learn in real world scenerios.

## Project Status

🚧 In Progress

This project is actively being developed as I continue learning
data structures and algorithms. New topics and improvements are
added regularly as my understanding deepens. This will be an ongoing 
project with new features added, optimization updates, UI/UX updates etc.

## Who This Is For

- CS students learning DSA
- Beginners looking for intuition-based explanations
- Anyone revising core data structures concepts
- Recruiters looking for proof of Skills.

##Thank you for taking the time to view my project, I would love feedback and am open to collaborations!
